-> Package.json is configuration file for npm.
-> react is a javascript library which is created by facebook developers
-> we can create our own create-react-app using webpack and all.

==> Bundler : -
-> Bundler is used to Bundle your applications which will deploy to production
-> bundler is small 
-> create-react app uses webpack bundler to deploy code into production
-> '^2.7.8' => 'major.minor.'
-> '^' -> caret => (caret is used to upgrade minor version of package)
-> '~' -> tilde => (tilde is use to upgrade major version of the package) 
-> package-lock.json is used to store exact version of the packages (dependencies)
-> Parcel uses babel

===> Transitive dependencies : 
->  When dependencies of modules 1 is depends on other and other modules have 
    dependencies of other modules and so on.. is known as transitive dependencies.
-> dependencies tree 

==> Parcel : -
    ->  Parcel is a zero configuration build tool for the web. 
        It combines a great out-of-the-box development experience with a scalable 
        architecture that can take your project from just getting started to 
        massive production application.
    => Things done by parcel
        -> HMR : hot module replacement (automatically run file when you save file)
        -> Dev Build
        -> Provide local server
        -> Parcel uses file watching algorithm (for HMR):- written in c++
        -> Gives you faster build because of caching(.parcel-cache kind 
           of binary file)
        -> Parcel does image optimization
        -> Minification of files (Project files)
        -> Bundling
        -> Compressing of files
        -> Parcel is manager (Parcel use all libraries to make react fast)
        -> Consistent hashing
        -> Code splitting
        -> Differentials bundling (to support older browser (diff. bundle for diff browser))
        -> Error handling
        -> Diagnostic
        -> Host app on Https 
        -> Tree Shaking (remove unused code for you)
        -> Create different dev and prod bundle
        -> npx parcel build index.html (building production build)
        -> Gives you only three files .js,.html and .css
        -> .parcel-cache and dist can be automatically generated
        -> Till lesson 2 we're created our own create react app
        -> not only react is making your faster , webpack are making your 
           app fast.

-> Build Application using Parcel:
    -> npx parcel source_file
    -> it creates dist file
    -> .parcel-cache
    -> npx means execute any package
    -> there are two kinds of dependencies in package.json 
        1) devDependencies (used only for develop and testing purpose not for production)
        2) dependencies (normal dependencies)
    "scripts": {
            "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
            "start":"parcel index.html",// for dev 
            "build":"parcel build index.html" // for prod
        }
    -> npm start === npm run start
    -> never run "npm build" instead run "npm run build" 

===> React Element:-
    -> ReactElement ==> Javascript Object ==> Html Element (when it is rendered)
    -> ReactElement is javascript Object
    -> JSX ==> ReactElement ==> Javascript Object ==> Html Element (when it is rendered)

===> React vs ReactDOM :-
-> React is used to create elements 
-> ReactDOM is used to display React elements into browser
-> JSX is way of writing javascript element
-> JSX is not HTML inside javascript
-> JSX is like HTML syntax  
--> const heading = React.createElement('h1',{id:"heading"},"Hello World");
    -> Element using react
--> const jsxHeading = <h1>Hello World</h1> (Element using jsx)
    -> above two lines are equivalent
    -> jsx is not pure javascript because browser and machine cannot understand this.
    -> jsx before going to browser (babel) webpack transpile the code so that browser can understand. 

==> Babel
-> Babel is open source javascript compiler
-> Babel transpile the newer javascript code to older JS code so that 
   older browser can understand that.
-> Learn more about babel

===> JSX :-
    -> const h1 = <h1>Hello World</h1> // Valid jsx
    -> const h1 = <h1>
                    Hello World 
                  </h1> // Invalid JSX
    -> const h1 = (<h1>
                    Hello World 
                  </h1>) // Valid JSX
    -> JSX is take care of injections attacks
    -> JSX also sanitized the data and prevent cross site scripting

===> Components : -
-> Everything in react is a component.
-> e.g. button , card ...etc
    1) Class based Components (old way of writing code )
    2) Functional Components (New way of writing code)
-> Functional component is normal js function which return some jsx
->  const HeadingComponent = ()=>{
        return (<h1>Functional Components</h1>)
    } // this is a react component
-> const HeadingComponent = () => <h1>Functional Components</h1>
-> this is how we render Components
    <HeadingComponent />;
    {HeadingComponent()};
    <HeadingComponent></HeadingComponent>;
-> components composition is components inside another components and so on.
-> write components in Capital latter.

===> Props :-
    -> Short form of properties
    -> props are just arguments to a function
    -> const fun = ({name,age,email}) => { 
            // parameter destructuring is know as destructuring on fly.
        }

===> Config driven UI :-
    ->  on same website when we change UI depends on the locations or something
        else is know as config driven UI. UI will changed based on requirements
    -> config comes from backend .
    -> We have control on UI.
    -> React say that never uses index as key. never never never.

===> React Hooks:-
-> Hooks are normal util javascript functions which do some special works
-> these are most useful react hooks.
-> useState() :- used to update UI based on state of the variable.
    -> whenever a state variable is updates react re-rendered the component.
    -> React only good at DOM manipulation.
--> useEffect()  :-
-> useEffect take two argument 
    -> useEffect(()=>{},[]) // this callback called after your component is rendered.
    -> callback function
    -> dependencies array

===> Shimmer UI:-
-> showing fake ui of any particular component which is similar to actual component without any data.
-> We use shimmer UI to show the symmetrical thing that user is going to experience.
-> We make fake impression (good impression ) on people.
-> 

===> Notes:
-> there is two way to export module.
    -> default export (export default anything) to import anything
    -> named export (export const data=[1,2]) to import use {data}
->  React is fast in DOM manipulation and this is the exact issue react is
    solving. This is why we use react. and all other trying to solving this issue.
-> Actual DOM :- <h1>Actual dom</h1>,<img> ...etc
-> Virtual DOM :- Representation of actual DOM.
    -> Virtual DOM is react-element and it will print javascript object.
->  Diff algorithm find out the diff between virtual DOM (Old and new Virtual DOM) 
    and then it will render the objects. this whole process is known as reconciliation or react fiber.
-> finding out difference between two html element is slow but between javascript object is fast.
    this where the react become fast.
-> React keeps track of all node (react elements)
->  Always use something to render first then fetch API so that your page does not look 
    frozen. (e.g. use loader). we use this for better user experience.
-> useEffect solving the above issue.
-> In react always first page is rendered then any special function is called (hooks).
-> fetch is given by the browser.
-> fetch always return a promise.
-> when promise is resolved then fetch gives you readable stream.
-> you have to parse the stream into json to get actual response/data.
->  if origin is mismatch then browser blocking the API call.Because it is not from the 
    given origin by backend.
-> you can bypass the CORS error by using chrome extension.
-> Optional chaining: person?.data?.name 
-> Render something based on some condition is known as conditional rendering.
    for instance: loading loader if data is not fetched.
-> we use state variable for two purpose
    1) to store data locally
    2) to re-render the component.
->  if state of any component is changed then that particular component re-render and only that
    particular element is changed .
-> const [name,setName] = useState('ravi')
    -> if name is constant then how its value getting updated?
    ->  Because after re-render of component (by setName method) name is created again and 
        with new value.and now the 'name' state variable is new variable. 
    ->  we have saw most of the time, after updating state variable, we won't see actual 
        changes in state variable.This is happens because the component is not re-rendered and
        for that time period state variable has older value.
            '   
                setName(name)
                name // this will show older value because component is not rendered and 'name' 
                variable value does not changed.

            '
-> Always remember:-whenever a local state variable is changing, react re-render that component.
                    and change the element for which this was rendered. or react triggers 
                    reconciliation cycle. 
-> Don't code fast, code slow (always understand why you are doing  and what you are doing)
